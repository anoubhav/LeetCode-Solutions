## Time and space complexity:

# BFS solution
# Since each node in the tree is visited / added to the queue only once, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

# Space complexity is O(n), since in the worst case, the queue will contain all nodes in one level of the binary tree. For a full binary tree, the leaf level has ceil(n/2) = O(n) leaves.

# Recursive solution
# Since each node in the tree is visited only once, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We cannot do better than that, since at the very least we have to visit each node to invert it.

# Because of recursion, O(h) function calls will be placed on the stack in the worst case, where h is the height of the tree. Because hâˆˆO(n), the space complexity is O(n).
